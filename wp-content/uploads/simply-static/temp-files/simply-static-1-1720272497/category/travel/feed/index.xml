<p>Who doesn&#8217;t enjoy waking up to the smell of fresh coffee in the morning? And if you have a coffee maker, chances are you use ground coffee.</p>



<p>While many coffee enthusiasts consider switching to grinding their own beans, it still holds true that most of us resort to pre-ground coffee most of the time.</p>



<p>And when it comes to pre-ground, perhaps you are tired of that same brand you&#8217;ve been using for years. Maybe you could use a dose of fresh inspiration to try something new.</p>



<p>That&#8217;s where this post comes in! We&#8217;ve researched tons of ground coffees on the market to bring you only the best. If you&#8217;re looking to try out something new, then this post is for you!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Volcanica Coffee &#8211; Ethiopian Yirgacheffe</strong></h2>



<p>This is a unique coffee that is harvested mainly from wild coffee trees. A medium roast with a sweet and complex flavor boasting hints of lemon and berry, this is one of the company&#8217;s best sellers by far &#8211; and we can see why.</p>



<p>It is grown in the Yirgacheffe region in the south of Ethiopia, known for coffees with floral and berry tones. Volcanica is also fair trade and organic certified.</p>



<p>They offer three different grind sizes: French press, drip, or espresso. We highly recommend giving this one a shot!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Lifeboost Light Roast Coffee</strong></h2>



<p>Lifeboost is a premium organic coffee brand.</p>



<p>Their light roast is a single origin from the Nicaraguan Mountains, grown without pesticides, chemicals, GMOs, or mycotoxins. Their coffee is also fair trade certified.</p>



<p>This one has a mild clean taste free of bitterness, with hints of caramel chocolate topped by a light and fruity flavor. It is also gentle on the stomach due to its naturally low levels of acid.</p>



<p>You won&#8217;t regret trying this one if you like the idea of a fresh, organic, premium coffee!</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Strong Blend Coffee &#8211; Dark Roast</strong></h2>



<p>True to its name, this blend is certainly not for the faint-hearted. It has twice as much caffeine as a normal coffee (or more) and comes with incredibly strong flavors.</p>



<p>The dark roast beans make for an almost burnt flavor but also dark chocolate, according to some palates. But this is exactly why many customers love it.</p>



<p>This roast will shine when brewed with drip machines or French press. If you like your coffee strong, give this one a shot!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Koa Coffee &#8211; Medium Roast</strong></h2>



<p>Koa has long made a name for themselves in the pre-ground coffee world. They are probably the most widely known producer of the award-winning Kona coffee. It is grown on the Kona coffee belt in Hawaii.</p>



<p>Hailing from one of the best coffee growing regions in the world, it is definitely one of the most intriguing options on our list! Albeit on the expensive side, if you like your coffee smooth and rich with hints of fruit, try this!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Mountain Horse Coffee Smart Blend</strong></h2>



<p>Mountain Horse has a strong following of coffee lovers and is one of the most popular pre-grounds on Amazon &#8211; and we think this is for good reason. They have 6 different varieties that range from light roasts to dark ones.</p>



<p>This Smart Blend is a medium roast and comes with chocolaty flavors together with a fruity aroma.</p>



<p>A particularly good choice when used with a drip machine or cold brew.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>New England Coffee Medium Roast</strong></h2>



<p>Although not super popular, the New England Coffee brand is over 100 years old and is a staple among coffee connoisseurs.</p>



<p>All of that experience truly shows with this Medium Roast they offer. Flavors available include blueberry, French vanilla, donut shop, pumpkin spice, and more.</p>



<p>If you enjoy flavored coffee, I would definitely give this one a shot.</p>



<p>It is one of a kind!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Things To Consider When Choosing Your Coffee</strong></h2>



<p>Make sure you consider the type of roast you prefer (light to dark), the grind size (based on your brewing method of choice), and of course the flavor profile.</p>



<p>Everyone has different tastes when it comes to coffee, and that&#8217;s a good thing.</p>



<p>Hopefully, we&#8217;ve given you one or two new ideas to try out inside this post. And if so, let us know how your chosen coffee was &#8211; we&#8217;d love to hear back from you!</p>
